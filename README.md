# "Oregon Hunger Equation" Frontend

The frontend code for Hack Oregon's "Oregon Hunger Equation" lives here. This project is based on some of the work done in the [Raise Effect](http://raiseeffect.org) project. It is an ES6 React-based application packaged with webpack.

Assuming you have Node.js and NPM installed:
```bash
git clone [repo]
npm install
npm run start
```
The webpack development server will listen on port 3333.
